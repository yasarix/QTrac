#QTrac
QTrac is a small Trac client that allows you to create custome queries and watch tickets that you want.

I'm using QT to create its UI.

It is not ready to use yet, I just started to develop it.

##Requirements
In order to run QTrac, you need Python 2.7, QT and PyQT4 installed on your computer.
